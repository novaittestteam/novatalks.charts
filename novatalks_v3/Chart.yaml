description: Novatalks Deployment from NovaIT DEV Team.
# A chart can be either an 'application' or a 'library' chart.
# 
# Application charts are a collection of templates that can be packaged into versioned archives
# to be deployed.
# 
# Library charts provide useful utilities or functions for the chart developer. They're included as
# a dependency of application charts to inject those utilities and functions into the rendering
# pipeline. Library charts do not define any templates and therefore cannot be deployed.
# type: application
type: application

# This is the chart version. This version number should be incremented each time you make changes
# to the chart and its templates, including the app version.
version: 3.33.0

# This is the version number of the application being deployed. This version number should be
# incremented each time you make changes to the application and it is recommended to use it with quotes.
